# hazzaCommon
A single-filed repository containing my common utilities

# Motive:

What it says on the tin, really... 

# Building:

```
git clone 

make clean

make
```

the output of this should be a lib file called ``hazzaCommon.so``

from there, feel free to drag and drop it in ``/usr/local/include`` to use asynchronously across programs
